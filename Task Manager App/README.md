Task Manager - Davis Shriver

This Java Web Application was developed as apart of a Udemy course entitled "Master Spring Boot 3 & Spring Framework 6 with 
Java" by in28minutes. The application is meant to display a basic understanding of Java, Spring Framework, Spring Boot, HTML, SQL, MySQL, JSP, and other technologies.
I have learned great deal from developing this simple application and I am eager to apply produce more applications in the future.

Functionality:
The application is hosted on the local device and allows for 2 users to log in (although more may be added). Each user has a specific set of "Todos" or tasks that they can
add, delete, or modify. This application is useful for tracking simple or complex tasks that need to be completed. The tasks and their information are stored on a MySQL
database.
